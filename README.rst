LLSpy is a python library to facilitate lattice light sheet data processing. It extends the cudaDeconv binary created in the Betzig lab at Janelia Research Campus, adding features that auto-detect experimental parameters from the data folder structure and metadata (minimizing user input), auto-choose OTFs, perform image corrections and manipulations, and facilitate file handling.  Full(er) documentation available at http://llspy.readthedocs.io/

**There are three ways to use LLSpy:**

1. Graphical User Interface
===========================

The GUI provides access to the majority of functionality in LLSpy. It includes a drag-and drop queue, visual progress indicator, and the ability to preview data processed with the current settings using the (awesome) 4D-viewer, `Spimagine <https://github.com/maweigert/spimagine>`_ developed by Martin Weigert in the `Myers lab <https://www.mpi-cbg.de/research-groups/current-groups/gene-myers/research-focus/>`_ at MPI-CBG.  Support for online-processing with a "monitored  folder" or real-time visualization with Spimagine is in development.

3. Interactive data processing in a python console
==================================================

.. code:: python

    >>> import llspy

    # the LLSdir object contains most of the useful attributes and
    # methods for interacting with a data folder containing LLS tiffs
    >>> E = llspy.LLSdir('path/to/experiment_directory')
    # it parses the settings file into a dict:
    >>> E.settings
    {'acq_mode': 'Z stack',
     'basename': 'cell1_Settings.txt',
     'camera': {'cam2name': '"Disabled"',
                'cycle': '0.01130',
                'cycleHz': '88.47 Hz',
                'exp': '0.01002',
        ...
    }

    # many important attributes are in the parameters dict
    >>> E.parameters
    {'angle': 31.5,
     'dx': 0.1019,
     'dz': 0.5,
     'nc': 2,
     'nt': 10,
     'nz': 65,
     'samplescan': True,
      ...
    }

    # and provides methods for processing the data
    >>> E.autoprocess()

    # the autoprocess method accepts many options as keyword aruguments
    # a full list with descriptions can be seen here:
    >>> llspy.printOptions()

                  Name  Default                    Description
                  ----  -------                    -----------
          correctFlash  False                      do Flash residual correction
    flashCorrectTarget  cpu                        {"cpu", "cuda", "parallel"} for FlashCor
                nIters  10                         deconvolution iters
             mergeMIPs  True                       do MIP merge into single file (decon)

                tRange  None                       time range to process (None means all)
                cRange  None                       channel range to process (None means all)
                   ...  ...                        ...

   # as well as file handling routines
   >>> E.compress(compression='lbzip2')  # compress the raw data into .tar.(bz2|gz)
   >>> E.decompress()  # decompress files for re-processing
   >>> E.freeze()  # delete all processed data and compress raw data for long-term storage.


*Note:* The LLSpy API is currently unstable (subject to change).  Look at the ``llspy.llsdir.LLSdir`` class as a starting point for most of the useful methods.  Minimal documentation available in the docs.  Feel free to fork this project on github and suggest changes or additions.


Requirements
============

* Compatible with Windows (tested on 7/10), Mac or Linux (tested on Ubuntu 16.04)
* Python 3.6 (recommended), 3.5, or 2.7
* Most functionality assumes a data folder structure as generated by the Lattice Scope LabeView acquisition software written by Dan Milkie in the Betzig lab.  If you are using different acquisition software, it is likely that you will need to change the data structure and metadata parsing routines.
* Currently, the core deskew/deconvolution processing is based on cudaDeconv, written by Lin Shao and maintained by Dan Milkie.  cudaDeconv is licensed and distributed by HHMI.  It is *not* included in this repository and must be acquired seperately in the dropbox share accessible after signing the RLA with HHMI.  Contact `innovation@janlia.hhmi.org <mailto:innovation@janelia.hhmi.org>`_.
* CudaDeconv requires a CUDA-capable GPU
* The Spimagine viewer requires a working OpenCL environment

Installation
============

**Note**: *The cudaDeconv binary and associated code is licensed by HHMI.  It is not included in this package and must be installed seperately.  See instructions below*


#. Install `Anaconda <https://www.anaconda.com/download/>`_ (python 3.6 is preferred, but 2.7 also works)
#. Launch a ``terminal`` window (OS X, Linux), or ``Anaconda Prompt`` (Windows)
#. Install LLSpy

    .. code:: bash

        > conda create -n llsenv
        > activate llsenv

        # or on OS X/Linux
        $ source activate llsenv

        > conda install -c talley -c conda-forge llspy

    The ``create -n llsenv`` line creates a virtual environment.  This is optional, but recommended as it easier to uninstall cleanly and prevents conflicts with any other python environments.  If installing into a virtual environment, you must source the environment before proceeding, and each time before using llspy.

#. Install Janelia binaries and libraries.  The binaries are included in the LLS Dropbox share (see requirements section).  Use the ``lls install`` command to install the libraries and binaries to the virtual environment.

    .. code:: bash

        > lls install /path/to/lls_dropbox/llspy_extra

#. Each time you use the program, you will need to activate the virtual environment (if you created one during installation).  The main command line interface is ``lls``, and the gui can be launched with ``lls gui``.  You can create a bash script or batch file to autoload the environment and launch the program if desired.

    .. code:: bash

        # Launch Anaconda Prompt and type...
        > activate llsenv  # Windows
        > source activate llsenv  # OS X or Linux

        # show the command line interface help menu
        > lls -h
        # process a dataset
        > lls decon /path/to/dataset
        # or launch the gui
        > lls gui


See complete usage notes in the `documentation <http://llspy.readthedocs.io/>`_.



Features of LLSpy
=================

* graphical user interface with persistent/saveable processing settings
* command line interface for remote/server usage (coming)
* preview processed image to verify settings prior to processing full experiment
* *Pre-processing corrections*:

  * correct "residual electron" issue on Flash4.0 when using overlap synchronous mode.  Includes CUDA and parallel CPU processing as well as GUI for generation of calibration file.
  * apply selective median filter to particularly noisy pixels
  * trim image edges prior to deskewing (helps with CMOS edge row artifacts)
  * auto-detect background

* Processing:

  * select subset of acquired images (C or T) for processing
  * automatic parameter detection based on auto-parsing of Settings.txt
  * automatic OTF generation/selection from folder of raw PSF files, based on date of acquisition, mask used (if entered into SPIMProject.ini), and wavelength.
  * graphical progress bar and time estimation

* Post-processing:

  * proper voxel-size metadata embedding (newer version of Cimg)
  * join MIP files into single hyperstack viewable in ImageJ/Fiji
  * automatic width/shift selection based on image content ("auto crop to features")
  * automatic fiducial-based image registration (provided tetraspeck bead stack)
  * compress raw data after processing

* Watched-folder autoprocessing (experimental):

  * Server mode: designate a folder to watch for incoming *finished* LLS folders (with Settings.txt file).  When new folders are detected, they are added to the processing queue and the queue is started if not already in progress.
  * Acquisition mode: designed to be used on the aquisition computer.  Designate folder to watch for new LLS folders, and process new files as they arrive.  Similar to built in GPU processing tab in Lattice Scope software, but with the addition of all the corrections and parameter selection in the GUI.

* easily return LLS folder to original (pre-processed) state
* compress and decompress folders and subfolders with lbzip2 (not working on windows)
* concatenate two experiments - renaming files with updated relative timestamps and stack numbers
* rename files acquired in script-editor mode with ``Iter_`` in the name to match standard naming with positions (work in progress)
* cross-platform: includes precompiled binaries and shared libraries that should work on all systems.


Bug Reports, Feature requests, etc...
=====================================

Pull requests are welcome!

To report a bug or request a feature, please `submit an issue on github <https://github.com/tlambert03/LLSpy/issues>`_

Please include the following in any bug reports:

- Operating system version
- GPU model
- CUDA version (type ``nvcc --version`` at command line prompt)
- Python version (type ``python --version`` at command line prompt, with ``llsenv`` conda environment active if applicable)

The most system-dependent component (and the most likely to fail) is the OpenCL dependency for Spimagine.  LLSpy will fall back gracefully to the built-in Qt-based viewer, but the Spimagine option will be will be unavailble and grayed out on the config tab in the GUI.  Submit an `issue on github <https://github.com/tlambert03/LLSpy/issues>`_ for help.
